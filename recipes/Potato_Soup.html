        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place bacon in a Dutch oven and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, 
                <br> until evenly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain bacon pieces on paper towels. Drain off 
                <br> all but 1/4 cup of the bacon grease.
            </li>

            <li>
                Cook celery and onion in the reserved bacon drippings until onion is soft and 
                <br>translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes. 
                <br>Add cubed potatoes, and toss to coat. Saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Return bacon to the pan,
                <br> and add enough chicken stock to just cover the potatoes. Cover, and simmer until potatoes
                <br>  are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, melt butter in a separate skillet over medium heat. Whisk in flour. Cook, stirring
                <br> constantly, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in heavy cream, tarragon, and cilantro. Bring cream mixture
                <br>  to a boil, and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add cream mixture 
                <br>  to the potato mixture; stir to combine.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer about 1/2 of the soup to a blender and puree. Return to the Dutch oven. Adjust seasonings to taste.
            </li>
        </ol>
